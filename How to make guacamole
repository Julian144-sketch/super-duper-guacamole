Making **classic guacamole** is quick and simple 🌮🥑

### Ingredients (basic version)

* 2 ripe avocados
* 1 small lime (or lemon)
* Salt, to taste

### Optional add-ins (very common)

* 1–2 tbsp finely chopped red onion
* 1 small tomato, diced (seeds removed)
* 1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 small jalapeño or chili, finely chopped
* 1 small garlic clove, minced

### Instructions

1. **Prep the avocados**
   Cut avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a bowl.

2. **Mash**
   Mash with a fork until chunky or smooth—your preference.

3. **Season**
   Add lime juice and salt. Mix well.

4. **Add extras (optional)**
   Fold in onion, tomato, cilantro, chili, and garlic if using.

5. **Taste & adjust**
   Add more salt or lime juice as needed.

### Tips for great guacamole

* Use **ripe avocados** (they should yield slightly when pressed).
* Add lime juice early to keep it from browning.
* Keep it chunky—over-mixing makes it pasty.
* For storage, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface.

If you want, I can tailor it—**Mexican-style**, **no onion**, **spicy**, or **for tacos vs. chips** 😄
